text = '''The main emphasis will be on end-to-end data handling, analysis, and presentation for monitoring and decision support. Through various use cases, data will be accessed from databases, repositories, and/or sensors, filtered/cleaned, combined/analyzed, and displayed for the end user. Dashboards with plots and key performance indicators will be the main output.

The course supports the UN's sustainability goals 4 (good education - industrial relevance for students), 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure - better utilization of industrial data, internal and external infrastructure), 10 (less inequality - use of open platforms, programming languages and tools) and 12 (responsible consumption and production - streamlining and improving production processes).'''
